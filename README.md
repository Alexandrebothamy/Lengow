Authors: [Benjamin perche](benjamin@thelia.net) and [Romain Ducher](rducher@openstudio.fr)

This module enables you to export your catalog to marketplaces, price comparison sites and more with Lengow.

For this, go to Thelia's back office and Lengow module's configuration. There you will be able to configure your export to Lengow.
Lengow will ask an export to Thelia based on what you configure but you can also ask for a manual export by clicking on the corresponding button.
